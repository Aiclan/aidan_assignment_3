0,All Things Will Die,https://www.simple-poetry.com/poems/all-things-will-die-35392463820,"All Things will Die Clearly the blue river chimes in its flowing Under my eye; Warmly and broadly the south winds are blowing Over the sky. One after another the white clouds are fleeting; Every heart this May morning in joyance is beating Full merrily; Yet all things must die. The stream will cease to flow; The wind will cease to blow; The clouds will cease to fleet; The heart will cease to beat; For all things must die. All things must die. Spring will come never more. O, vanity! Death waits at the door. See! our friends are all forsaking The wine and the merrymaking. We are calldwe must go. Laid low, very low, In the dark we must lie. The merry glees are still; The voice of the bird Shall no more be heard, Nor the wind on the hill. O, misery! Hark! death is calling While I speak to ye, The jaw is falling, The red cheek paling, The strong limbs failing; Ice with the warm blood mixing; The eyeballs fixing. Nine times goes the passing bell: Ye merry souls, farewell. The old earth Had a birth, As all men know, Long ago. And the old earth must die. So let the warm winds range, And the blue wave beat the shore; For even and morn Ye will never see Thro eternity. All things were born. Ye will come never more, For all things must die."
1,A Farewell,https://www.simple-poetry.com/poems/a-farewell-60361038435,"Flow down, cold rivulet, to the sea, Thy tribute wave deliver: No more by thee my steps shall be, For ever and for ever. Flow, softly flow, by lawn and lea, A rivulet then a river: Nowhere by thee my steps shall be For ever and for ever. But here will sigh thine alder tree And here thine aspen shiver; And here by thee will hum the bee, For ever and for ever. A thousand suns will stream on thee, A thousand moons will quiver; But not by thee my steps shall be, For ever and for ever."
2,Adeline,https://www.simple-poetry.com/poems/adeline-83046182883,"I. Mystery of mysteries, Faintly smiling Adeline, Scarce of earth nor all divine, Nor unhappy, nor at rest, But beyond expression fair With thy floating flaxen hair; Thy rose-lips and full blue eyes Take the heart from out my breast. Wherefore those dim looks of thine, Shadowy, dreaming Adeline? II. Whence that aery bloom of thine, Like a lily which the sun Looks thro in his sad decline, And a rose-bush leans upon, Thou that faintly smilest still, As a Naiad in a well, Looking at the set of day, Or a phantom two hours old Of a maiden passed away, Ere the placid lips be cold? Wherefore those faint smiles of thine, Spiritual Adeline? III. What hope or fear or joy is thine? Who talketh with thee, Adeline? For sure thou art not all alone: Do beating hearts of salient springs Keep measure with thine own? Hast thou heard the butterflies What they say betwixt their wings? Or in stillest evenings With what voice the violet woos To his heart the silver dews? Or when little airs arise, How the merry bluebell rings To the mosses underneath? Hast thou lookd upon the breath Of the lilies at sunrise? Wherefore that faint smile of thine, Shadowy, dreaming Adeline? IV. Some honey-converse feeds thy mind, Some spirit of a crimson rose In love with thee forgets to close His curtains, wasting odorous sighs All night long on darkness blind. What aileth thee? whom waitest thou With thy softend, shadowd brow, And those dew-lit eyes of thine, Thou faint smiler, Adeline? V. Lovest thou the doleful wind When thou gazest at the skies? Doth the low-tongued Orient Wander from the side of the morn, Dripping with Sabsean spice On thy pillow, lowly bent With melodious airs lovelorn, Breathing Light against thy face, While his locks a-dropping twined Round thy neck in subtle ring Make a carcanet of rays, And ye talk together still, In the language wherewith Spring Letters cowslips on the hill? Hence that look and smile of thine, Spiritual Adeline."
3,Battle of Brunanburgh,https://www.simple-poetry.com/poems/battle-of-brunanburgh-28755318929,"Athelstan King, Lord among Earls, Bracelet-bestower and Baron of Barons, He with his brother, Edmund Atheling, Gaining a lifelong Glory in battle, Slew with the sword-edge There by Brunanburh, Brake the shield-wall, Hew'd the lindenwood, Hack'd the battleshield, Sons of Edward with hammer'd brands. Theirs was a greatness Got from their Grandsires-- Theirs that so often in Strife with their enemies Struck for their hoards and their hearths and their homes. Bow'd the spoiler, Bent the Scotsman, Fell the shipcrews Doom'd to the death. All the field with blood of the fighters Flow'd, from when first the great Sun-star of morningtide, Lamp of the Lord God Lord everlasting, Glode over earth till the glorious creature Sank to his setting. There lay many a man Marr'd by the javelin, Men of the Northland Shot over shield. There was the Scotsman Weary of war. We the West-Saxons, Long as the daylight Lasted, in companies Troubled the track of the host that we hated; Grimly with swords that were sharp from the grindstone Fiercely we hack'd at the flyers before us. Mighty the Mercian, Hard was his hand-play, Sparing not any of Those that with Anlaf, Warriors over the Weltering waters Borne in the bark's-bosom, Drew to this island: Doom'd to the death. Five young kings put asleep by the sword-stroke, Seven strong earls of the army of Anlaf Fell on the war-field, numberless numbers, Shipmen and Scotsmen. Then the Norse leader, Dire was his need of it, Few were his following, Fled to his warship; Fleeted his vessel to sea with the king in it, Saving his life on the fallow flood. Also the crafty one, Constantinus, Crept to his north again, Hoar-headed hero! Slender warrant had He to be proud of The welcome of war-knives-- He that was reft of his Folk and his friends that had Fallen in conflict, Leaving his son too Lost in the carnage, Mangled to morsels, A youngster in war! Slender reason had He to be glad of The clash of the war-glaive-- Traitor and trickster And spurner of treaties-- He nor had Anlaf With armies so broken A reason for bragging That they had the better In perils of battle On places of slaughter-- The struggle of standards, The rush of the javelins, The crash of the charges, The wielding of weapons-- The play that they play'd with The children of Edward. Then with their nail'd prows Parted the Norsemen, a Blood-redden'd relic of Javelins over The jarring breaker, the deep-sea billow, Shaping their way toward Dyflen again, Shamed in their souls. Also the brethren, King and Atheling, Each in his glory, Went to his own in his own West-Saxonland, Glad of the war. Many a carcase they left to be carrion, Many a livid one, many a sallow-skin-- Left for the white-tail'd eagle to tear it, and Left for the horny-nibb'd raven to rend it, and Gave to the garbaging war-hawk to gorge it, and That gray beast, the wolf of the weald. Never had huger Slaughter of heroes Slain by the sword-edge-- Such as old writers Have writ of in histories-- Hapt in this isle, since Up from the East hither Saxon and Angle from Over the broad billow Broke into Britain with Haughty war-workers who Harried the Welshman, when Earls that were lured by the Hunger of glory gat Hold of the land."
4,After-Thought,https://www.simple-poetry.com/poems/after-thought-59396218381,"I thought of Thee, my partner and my guide, As being past away. -Vain sympathies! For backward, Duddon! as I cast my eyes, I see what was, and is, and will abide; Still glides the Stream, and shall not cease to glide; The Form remains, the Function never dies; While we, the brave, the mighty, and the wise, We Men, who in our morn of youth defied The elements, must vanish; -be it so! Enough, if something from our hands have power To live, and act, and serve the future hour; And if, as toward the silent tomb we go, Through love, through hope, and faith's transcendent dower, We feel that we are greater than we know."
